# Valorant Rotation Store

This project is developed to solve the issue of not being able to view Valorant store without logging into the PC client. This repository is the front-end implementation of this project. The [backend](https://github.com/dinhlongviolin1/flask-valorant) is a pure API implementation which does not collect user data. User data (username, password) will only be used to fetch Riot Authentication Token.
